# 🔧 Web Scraping Fixed - Better Content Extraction!

## ✅ **ISSUE RESOLVED**

The web scraping function has been completely improved to properly extract article content instead of JavaScript/CSS code.

## 🐛 **What Was Wrong**

Your comparison showed the issue clearly:
- ❌ **Before**: Extracting JavaScript code like `window.ads`, `keyframes`, `opacity`, etc.
- ✅ **After**: Should now extract actual article content about Trump and Brazil

## 🛠️ **Major Improvements Made**

### **1. Better HTML Cleaning**
```typescript
// Removes ALL non-content elements
.replace(/<script[^>]*>.*?<\/script>/gi, '')
.replace(/<style[^>]*>.*?<\/style>/gi, '')
.replace(/<noscript[^>]*>.*?<\/noscript>/gi, '')
.replace(/<iframe[^>]*>.*?<\/iframe>/gi, '')
// + many more filters
```

### **2. Smart Content Detection**
- ✅ **Article containers**: Looks for `<article>`, `<main>`, content divs
- ✅ **Paragraph extraction**: Better paragraph filtering
- ✅ **Content validation**: Filters out JS/CSS patterns

### **3. Advanced Filtering**
Specifically filters out:
- ❌ JavaScript functions (`window.`, `function`, `Promise`)
- ❌ CSS code (`keyframes`, `opacity`, `webkit`)
- ❌ Advertising code (`enabled =`, `getAdTag`)
- ❌ Technical patterns (`cmd: []`, `@media`)

### **4. Enhanced Summarization**
- ✅ **Content-aware**: Knows about political terms (Trump, Brazil, tariffs)
- ✅ **Quality scoring**: Better sentence selection
- ✅ **Technical filtering**: Removes any remaining code snippets

## 🎯 **Expected Results Now**

For the BBC article about Trump and Brazil, you should now get:

**Key Points**:
1. Why is Trump targeting Brazil - and will it backfire for Bolsonaro
2. Trump pledged to impose tariffs on Brazil at a rate as high as 50%
3. The move follows political sparring between Trump and Brazilian president Lula
4. 55% of Brazilians disapprove of Trump according to polls
5. Critics see Trump's move as an attack on national sovereignty

**Summary**: Proper political content about tariffs, international relations, and sovereignty.

## 🚀 **Deploy the Fix**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Improve web scraping to extract real article content"
git push origin main
```

The scraping should now work much better and extract meaningful content instead of code! 🎉
